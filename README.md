# Atlanta
A poor man's [Atlantis](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis).

Atlantis is pretty opinionated about what your terraform workflow should be, Atlanta is not.

Atlanta should plug into your CI/CD system work the way YOU want it to.

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your brow
ser.
